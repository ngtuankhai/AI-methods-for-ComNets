## Getting Started with Google Colab

The files are designed to be run in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)#

### Prerequisites

- A Google account for accessing Google Colab.
- The project files, including the `.ipynb` notebooks and the required datasets.

### Accessing the Notebook

1. Navigate to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. Sign in with your Google account.
3. Click on `File` > `Open notebook`.
4. Select the `GitHub` tab, enter the URL of the repository containing the project, and then select for example the `Hands-on Exercise 1 - Pandas.ipynb` notebook to open it.

### Uploading Required Files

For the `Hands-on Exercise 1 - Pandas.ipynb` notebook, you will need two specific Excel files:

- `Universities.csv`
- `african_econ_crises.csv`

To upload these files to your Colab environment, follow these steps:

1. In the Colab notebook, click on the folder icon in the left sidebar to open the file browser.
2. Click on the upload button (represented by an icon with an arrow pointing up) to upload the `Universities.csv` and `african_econ_crises.csv` files from your computer.
3. Ensure these files are in the root directory of your Colab file browser to easily access them from the notebook.

### Exercise Format

Each exercise notebook starts with a theoretical introduction to the concepts being taught, followed by practical examples. At the end of each notebook, except for the NetworkX exercise, there is a detailed exercise for the learner to complete. To assist in the learning process, we have included empty cells for students to write their code, as well as additional cells that contain only the visualization of the expected results. This setup allows students to verify their answers independently.
